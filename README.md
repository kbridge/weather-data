Pre-saved weather data for use with chapter 5 of the [pandas-cookbook](https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook).

The original site is `http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/bulk_data_e.html?stationID=5415&Year={year}&Month={month}&format=csv&timeframe=1&submit=%20Download+Data`, which is slow to access (at least for me).
